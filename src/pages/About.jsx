      <h1>About Me.</h1>
      <p>
        I’m a former Business Management Analyst transitioning into software
        engineering, driven by a passion for problem-solving, efficiency, and
        creating impactful digital solutions. My background in analyzing complex
        business processes and translating data into actionable insights has
        given me a strong foundation in logical thinking and project
        management—skills I now bring to software development.
